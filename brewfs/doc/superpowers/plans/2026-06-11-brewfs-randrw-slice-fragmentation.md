# BrewFS Randrw Slice Fragmentation Follow-up Plan

## Goal

Close the BrewFS `fio-randrw` gap by reducing small-slice and small-object amplification without hiding cost in page cache or post-fio drain.

  slice_create_ops=872, slice_reuse_ops=3284
  freeze_size/max_unflushed/explicit_flush/auto=7/76/95/694
```

Interpretation:

- `direct0` is dominated by sub-block upload batches, not post-write drain.
- `max_unflushed` freezes are the primary source of direct0 fragmentation: 11,128 freezes versus 51 size freezes.
- 95.5% of direct0 upload batches include a frozen partial tail, so most PUTs are small object fragments.
- `direct1` already has much larger batches and low partial-tail ratio, so any fix must protect direct1 write p99 and drain time.

## Hypothesis

`ChunkHandle::find_slice_or_create` freezes older writable slices as soon as they are more than `MAX_UNFLUSHED_SLICES` away from the newest slice. Under buffered random writeback (`direct=0`), this freezes many sub-block slices before they have a chance to absorb overwrites. Delaying that specific `max_unflushed` freeze for sub-block slices should reduce partial-tail batch count and PUT count.

## Candidate A

Change only the `max_unflushed` freeze path:

- Do not freeze a writable slice for `max_unflushed` unless its logical length is at least one block.
- Leave explicit flush, size/chunk-end freeze, auto-flush, pressure flush, and commit-age safety unchanged.
- Keep the change local and reversible; if memory or direct1 tail regresses, reject it.

Expected movement:

- `fio-randrw-direct0` `writeback_freeze_max_unflushed_ops` decreases.
- `fio-randrw-direct0` `writeback_upload_partial_tail_ops / writeback_upload_batch_ops` decreases.
- `fio-randrw-direct0` `s3_put_ops_per_gib_written` decreases.
- `fio-randrw-direct1` read/write BW does not regress by more than 5%, and write p99/p99.9 does not regress by more than 25%.

  slice_create_ops=768, slice_reuse_ops=3004
  freeze_size/max_unflushed/explicit_flush/auto=8/81/86/593
```

Movement versus baseline:

- `direct0` max-unflushed freezes dropped from 11,128 to 120 (-98.9%).
- `direct0` S3 PUT count dropped from 12,970 to 11,180 while fio wrote 16.7% more data.
- `direct0` S3 PUTs per GiB written improved from about 2,215 to 1,636 (-26.1%).
- `direct0` average upload batch size improved from 0.462 MiB to 0.626 MiB (+35.5%).
- `direct0` write bandwidth improved from 84.5 MiB/s to 115.2 MiB/s (+36.2%).
- `direct1` write bandwidth moved from 59.5 MiB/s to 56.7 MiB/s (-4.7%), drain improved from 32s to 27s, and write p99 improved from 10.4s to 7.9s.
- `direct1` read bandwidth was -5.6%, just outside the planned 5% guard band, so run a direct1-only guard before accepting the code.

Interpretation:

- Candidate A is directionally effective for buffered randrw: it converts premature `max_unflushed` partial-tail freezes into slice reuse and larger uploads.
- Remaining `direct0` partial-tail ratio is still high at 93.2%, so the next bottleneck is auto/explicit flush of sub-block tails rather than `max_unflushed`.
- Direct I/O must remain protected in follow-up work; the current result is close enough to the guard band to require a direct1 repeat before commit.

  avg_upload_batch_mib=4.091 vs 4.047 (+1.1%)
  partial_tail_ratio=0.032 vs 0.032
```

Decision:

- Accept Candidate A.
- It improves buffered random write fragmentation and does not show a stable direct I/O regression.
- Next optimization target: reduce `direct0` auto/explicit flush partial-tail uploads while preserving direct1 batch shape and drain behavior.

## Candidate B Result

Hypothesis:

- Make background `flush_once()` non-strict so it does not seal sub-block tails.
- Delay cached-writeback sub-block `auto_flush` until the 5s safety age or memory pressure.
- Keep strict `flush()/fsync()/truncate()/close` semantics unchanged.

  write_bw_mib_s=56.0 vs 56.7
  post_write_drain_s=46 vs 27
```

Decision:

- Reject Candidate B.
- It reduced PUT/object amplification, but direct0 write bandwidth regressed by about 22% and direct1 post-write drain regressed by about 70%.
- The rollback keeps Candidate A as the current accepted code.

Interpretation:

- Delaying cached sub-block sealing too broadly shifts cost into dirty/backpressure queues: `writeback_hard_wait_ms` grew from about 9.3M to 28.4M in direct0.
- The next attempt should avoid holding dirty data longer globally. Prefer either per-reason metrics first, or a narrower change that reduces object count without increasing recent-pending hard waits.

## Post-Candidate B Attribution

Candidate C first step is observability, not behavior change.

Direct0-only result:

```text
direct0:

  partial_tail_explicit_flush=815
  partial_tail_max_unflushed=29
  partial_tail_size=64
  partial_tail_commit_age=0
```

Interpretation:

- Remaining direct0 partial-tail uploads are overwhelmingly from `Auto`: about 92.4% of all partial-tail batches in this run.
- Candidate A fixed premature `MaxUnflushed` sealing, but did not answer which auto trigger still seals the tail: max-age, idle, memory pressure, too-many-slices, or buffer-high.
- Next instrumentation should split `Auto` partial-tail uploads by trigger before another behavior change.

## Rejected Config: Pending Backpressure 2G/4G

Hypothesis:

- Raise `BREWFS_WRITEBACK_RECENT_PENDING_SOFT_BYTES` to 2GiB and hard limit to 4GiB.
- If hard waits are dominating, the higher threshold should reduce backpressure without code changes.

Command:

```bash

  partial_tail_ratio=0.965 vs 0.957
  partial_tail_auto=21058 vs 10988
  post_write_drain_s=0 vs 16
```

Decision:

- Reject this config for randrw.
- It hides drain and hard-wait symptoms by allowing a larger backlog, but the main fio runtime, write bandwidth, object count, and auto partial-tail count all worsen.

## Candidate C

Goal:

- Split `Auto` partial-tail attribution by trigger:
  `age`, `idle`, `pressure`, `too_many`, `buffer_high`, `flush_duration`, and `unknown`.
- Keep behavior unchanged in this step.
- Use direct0 perf to decide the next behavior candidate:
  if `age` dominates, test a narrow cached sub-block age deferral;
  if `pressure` dominates, test full-block-first pressure flushing;
  if `too_many` dominates, test slice-count policy changes;
  if `buffer_high` dominates, tune buffer-driven flushing.

partial_tail_auto=48

```

Decision:

- Accept Candidate C as useful observability.
- It does not attempt to improve behavior, but it identifies the next high-confidence bottleneck: `auto_age`.
- Direct0 did not regress in the measured run, and direct1 object amplification stayed effectively flat.
- Direct1 drain was longer than the best guard run, but the run also wrote 27% more data and had substantially higher read/write throughput; treat this as a guard to watch on behavior changes, not a reason to reject instrumentation.

## Candidate D

Goal:

- Reduce direct0 partial-tail object amplification by narrowing the `auto_age` trigger for cached-writeback sub-block slices.
- Preserve strict `flush()/fsync()/close()/truncate()` semantics.
- Preserve direct1 object shape and post-write drain.

Hypothesis:

- For direct0/kernel writeback cache, many tiny slices are being sealed solely because they are older than `auto_flush_max_age` (500ms in the perf profile).
- If a cached-writeback slice is still smaller than one block, `auto_age` should not immediately seal it. It should stay writable until it reaches a full block, hits explicit flush, hits memory pressure, or becomes constrained by too-many-slices cleanup.

Guard rails:

- Do not change explicit flush, fsync, close, truncate, or commit-age safety.
- Do not disable memory-pressure flush.
- Do not defer direct1/non-cached sub-block auto-age slices until a test proves it is safe.
- Reject if direct0 write bandwidth falls by more than 5%, hard-wait time grows materially, direct1 post-drain worsens materially, or direct1 PUT/GiB worsens by more than 5%.

Candidate D test target:

```text
test_auto_flush_defers_cached_sub_block_age_freeze_until_explicit_flush
```

Expected movement:

- direct0 `writeback_upload_partial_tail_auto_age_ops` decreases.
- direct0 `put_ops_per_gib_written` decreases.
- direct0 `writeback_avg_upload_batch_mib` increases.
- direct1 `writeback_partial_tail_ratio` remains about 0.03 and `avg_upload_batch_mib` remains about 4MiB.

## Candidate D Result

Implementation:

- Added `test_auto_flush_defers_cached_sub_block_age_freeze_until_explicit_flush`.
- Changed only the periodic auto-flush age path:
  if a writable slice was created by cached writeback (`creation_unique != 0`) and is still smaller than one block, `auto_age` does not freeze it.
- Kept explicit flush, fsync, close, truncate, pressure, too-many-slices, buffer-high, and non-cached direct write behavior unchanged.

Decision:

- Accept Candidate D.
- It reduces direct0 object amplification and hard-wait pressure without a direct1 object-shape regression.
- It is not sufficient as the final optimization because most remaining direct0 auto tails moved from `age` to `idle`. The next candidate should decide whether to defer cached sub-block `idle` too, or use a full-block-first/pressure-aware scan to avoid accumulating too many pending tiny slices.

direct0 remaining partial-tail attribution:
  auto_idle=8313
  explicit_flush=1718

## Rejected Candidate E: Defer Cached Sub-Block Idle

Hypothesis:

- Since Candidate D moved most direct0 auto tails from `age` to `idle`, also deferring cached sub-block `idle` could reduce direct0 object amplification without affecting explicit flush or pressure paths.

Implementation tested:

- Added a unit test proving cached sub-block slices are not auto-idle frozen before explicit flush.
- Changed the periodic auto-flush idle trigger from `idle_time > idle && age > idle` to also require `!cached_sub_block`.

```

Decision:

- Reject and roll back Candidate E.
- The direct0 object-amplification improvement is real, but the direct1 guard regresses read/write throughput by about 10%.
- The next attempt must reduce direct0 `auto_idle` object amplification without globally disabling idle freezes for cached sub-block slices.

Next target:

```text
Prefer a narrower direct0-only batching strategy:
  preserve idle freezing for direct1-like latency-sensitive traffic;
  batch only when the writer has clear evidence of kernel writeback/cache coalescing opportunity;
  keep direct1 throughput regression under 5%;
  keep direct0 post-drained PUT/GiB below Candidate D.
```

## Rejected Candidate F: Short Idle Grace for Cached Sub-Block Slices

Hypothesis:

- Candidate E was too broad because it disabled cached sub-block idle freezing until
  explicit flush/pressure/flush-duration paths.
- A small fixed idle grace could preserve most direct1 behavior while giving direct0
  kernel writeback-cache fragments one extra merge window.

Implementation tested:

- Added a 2s cached sub-block idle grace before `AutoFreezeTrigger::Idle`.
- Added a unit test proving cached sub-block slices are not auto-idle frozen at
  the normal 1s idle threshold, but are eventually frozen by the grace timeout.

writeback_hard_wait_ms=221.6k vs 193.2k (+14.7%)
write_p99_ms=6140 vs 4328 (+41.9%)
```

Decision:

- Reject and roll back Candidate F.
- Direct0 gains are real, especially on PUT/GiB and small-tail attribution, but
  the fixed grace increases direct1 latency enough to cut read/write throughput
  by about 19%.
- The next attempt should avoid fixed time grace and instead introduce an explicit
  write-origin/active-writeback signal. Current `creation_unique != 0` only means
  the slice was initially created by the cached path; it is not a reliable direct0
  versus direct1 signal once subsequent writes, flushes, and pressure interact.

Next target:

```text
Candidate G: add explicit writer-origin instrumentation before changing policy.
  track whether a slice has cached-writeback writes versus normal writes;
  expose counters for cached/direct/unknown sub-block auto-freeze attribution;
  use the signal to design an active-writeback-only idle deferral;
  preserve Candidate D as the performance baseline until the new signal proves useful.
```

## Candidate G Result: Write-Origin Attribution

Goal:

- Add behavior-neutral write-origin attribution before another idle/age policy
  change.
- Distinguish slices that were written only by the normal write path, only by
  the cached writeback path, by both paths, or by an unknown path.
- Export both live writeback origin gauges and cumulative partial-tail upload
  origin counters.

Implementation:

- Added `WriteOrigin` tracking to successful slice writes.
- Kept the writeback freeze/upload policy unchanged.
- Exported live origin gauges:
  `normal_only`, `cached_only`, `mixed_origin`, and `unknown_origin`.
- Exported partial-tail upload counters by origin, including auto-only origin
  counters.
- Extended the perf report and `compare_artifacts.py` so artifacts show
  `partial_origin=...` and `auto_origin=...`.

```

Note:

- A separate Codex task repeatedly launched cargo tests during this period, so
  treat direct0 throughput as potentially noisy.
- The object-shape signal is still useful: buffered randrw direct0 partial-tail
  uploads are overwhelmingly cached-origin tails, and the remaining auto
  triggers are mostly `idle` plus `too_many`.

```

Decision:

- Keep Candidate G as observability, not as a claimed throughput improvement.
- The origin signal is decisive enough for the next behavior candidate:
  direct0 remaining partial-tail amplification is cached-origin and mostly
  `auto_idle`; direct1 partial tails are normal-origin and still dominated by
  `auto_age`.
- Because direct1 throughput was lower in this run, the next behavior candidate
  must run a direct1 guard and reject any stable direct1 read/write regression
  above 5%.

Next target:

```text
Candidate H: cached-origin full-block-first idle cleanup.
  Do not use a fixed time grace.
  Do not change normal-origin direct1 idle/age behavior.
  When cached-origin sub-block slices are idle, prefer freezing/uploading full
  blocks and older/larger cached tails first.
  Only freeze tiny cached idle tails when slice-count/backpressure requires it.
  Accept only if direct0 PUT/GiB improves and direct1 read/write stays within
  the 5% guard band versus Candidate D.
```

## Rejected Candidate H: Cached-Only Sub-Block Idle Deferral

Goal:

- Use Candidate G's explicit write-origin signal instead of the older
  `creation_unique != 0` proxy.
- Defer `AutoFreezeTrigger::Idle` only for `cached_only` sub-block slices.
- Keep normal-origin direct1 age/idle behavior unchanged.
- Keep explicit flush, pressure, too-many-slices, buffer-high, and
  flush-duration paths active.

Implementation tested:

- Added a unit test proving cached-only sub-block slices are not frozen by idle
  auto-flush before explicit flush.
- Changed the periodic auto-flush path to skip both age and idle for
  `WriteOriginKind::CachedOnly` sub-block slices.

Decision:

- Reject and roll back Candidate H.
- The direct0 object-amplification improvement is strong, but the direct1 guard
  does not meet the 5% read/write regression limit.
- H does not appear to add a new direct1 object-shape regression versus
  Candidate G, but the current committed branch needs a clean rebaseline before
  another behavior change.

Next target:

```text
Candidate I: current-branch direct1 rebaseline and backpressure attribution.
  First rerun direct1 on the reverted/current committed behavior to separate
  Candidate G observation overhead from Candidate H behavior.
  If direct1 remains near -20% versus Candidate D, inspect origin metric update
  cost, writeback hard-wait timing, and S3 put latency before changing policy.
  If direct1 returns near Candidate D, resume cached-origin idle cleanup with a
  bounded full-block-first scanner that avoids increasing hard_wait.
```

## Candidate I Result: Same-Time Direct1 Control

Goal:

- Determine whether the current direct1 throughput drop is caused by Candidate
  G/H code, or by the test environment/object-store latency changing between
  runs.
- Compare current branch against exact Candidate D code in the same time window.

Method:

- Reverted Candidate H behavior first; current branch kept only accepted code
  plus Candidate G observability.
- Created a detached worktree at exact Candidate D commit `d1cfa1a`.
- Ran both with identical command shape:

```bash
PERF_TOOLS="fio-randrw" \
PERF_FIO_DIRECT_MATRIX="1" \
PERF_FIO_POST_WRITE_DRAIN=true \
PERF_FIO_POST_WRITE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SECS=900 \

writeback_hard_wait_ms=220.2k vs 223.4k (-1.4%)
```

Decision:

- Candidate G/H are not the source of the apparent direct1 throughput drop.
- The old Candidate D artifact is no longer a valid direct1 throughput baseline
  for current comparisons because exact D code now reproduces the same lower
  throughput in the same environment.
- Use same-time controls for future behavior candidates. Direct1 guard should
  compare candidate code against a nearby D/current control, not against the old
  high-throughput artifact alone.

Next target:

```text
Candidate J: bounded cached-origin full-block-first idle cleanup.
  Keep direct1 normal-origin behavior unchanged.
  Use current/same-time D direct1 as the guard baseline.
  Optimize direct0 by reducing cached-origin auto_idle tiny-tail uploads, but
  bound dirty backlog so hard_wait does not grow more than 5% versus current.
  Accept only if direct0 post-drained PUT/GiB improves and same-time direct1
  read/write stays within 5%.
```

## Candidate J Result: Bounded Cached-Only Idle Grace

Goal:

- Reduce buffered randrw small-object amplification caused by cached-origin
  sub-block slices being sealed at the one-second idle point.
- Keep the direct1 normal-origin path inside the 5% guard band.
- Bound the grace window so cached-origin dirty backlog cannot wait until the
  long flush-duration fallback.

Implementation:

- Classify cached sub-block slices with `WriteOriginKind::CachedOnly` instead
  of `creation_unique != 0`.
- Defer `AutoFreezeTrigger::Idle` for cached-only sub-block slices for three
  seconds.
- Keep pressure, too-many-slices, buffer-high, explicit flush, and
  flush-duration triggers intact.
- Added a regression test that verified RED on the old one-second idle freeze
  and GREEN with bounded grace.

writeback_hard_wait_ms=209.7k vs 220.2k (-4.7%)
```

Decision:

- Accept Candidate J with a three-second cached-only sub-block idle grace.
- This keeps the direct1 guard within the configured 5% band while improving
  buffered randrw throughput, drain time, object count, and partial-tail count.
- Residual risk: direct0 run still reported a small number of best-effort
  writeback stage failures. These have appeared in previous guard runs and are
  logged as skipped SSD persist rather than foreground I/O errors, but the next
  round should add clearer failure-cause attribution.

Next target:

```text
Candidate K: reduce direct0 explicit-flush/too-many spillover after the 3s
cached-idle grace. The 3s candidate cuts idle tails but still shifts some
freezes to TooMany and ExplicitFlush. Inspect slice ordering and cached-origin

groups without increasing hard_wait.
```
