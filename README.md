BrewFS is a Rust filesystem for container, AI, and object-storage-heavy workloads. It exposes a POSIX-like FUSE interface, stores file data as chunked objects, and keeps namespace and slice metadata in a pluggable transactional metadata backend.

The core design goal is to decouple compute from storage: applications read and write normal paths, while BrewFS handles chunk layout, object IO, caching, metadata transactions, compaction, and garbage collection.

## Architecture

Main layers:

- `fuse` and `vfs`: inode-based FUSE integration and POSIX-facing behavior.
- `meta`: metadata client, transaction-capable backends, sessions, control plane, compaction hooks, and GC metadata.
- `chunk`: chunk/block layout, read/write path, cache, compaction, delayed deletion, and block-store GC.
- `cadapter`: object backend abstraction with LocalFS and S3-compatible implementations.
- `fs` and SDK examples: path-based API and local examples that can run without FUSE.

Default data layout:

- Chunk size: 64 MiB
- Block size: 4 MiB
- Object granularity: blocks addressed under slice IDs

## Current Capabilities

Data backends:

- `local-fs`: stores object data in a local directory for development and tests.
- `s3`: supports AWS S3 and S3-compatible services such as RustFS, MinIO, and Ceph RGW.

Metadata backends:

- `sqlx`: SQLite for local/dev and PostgreSQL for server deployments.
- `redis`: low-latency metadata operations with Lua/CAS based chunk updates.
- `etcd`: distributed KV metadata with transaction and watch-oriented semantics.
- `tikv`: transactional TiKV metadata backend with namespace, file data, hardlinks, symlinks, rename exchange, compaction hooks, and delayed/uncommitted slice GC support.

Filesystem and runtime features:

- FUSE mount via `brewfs mount`
- Path/inode operations for create, mkdir, readdir, stat, read, write, truncate, unlink, rmdir, rename, hardlink, and symlink
- Chunked sparse IO with zero-fill for holes
- Read/write cache with memory and SSD budgets
- Optional S3 writeback mode (`commit_before_upload`) with orphan cleanup support
- Slice compaction and two-phase block deletion
- Runtime control plane for `brewfs info` and `brewfs gc`

## Performance Snapshot

Current Redis + S3-compatible RustFS perf runs use `fio` with `io_uring`, `iodepth=1`, buffered IO, 4 MiB blocks, BrewFS writeback throughput profile, no compression, 6 FUSE workers, 4 GiB read/write SSD cache budgets, full cache checksum verification, and a 1s/65k open metadata cache. JuiceFS is v1.3.1 with writeback, 8192 MiB buffer, 4096 MiB cache, 4 uploads, and the same open-cache limit.

Artifacts:

- BrewFS kept full run: `docker/compose-xfstests/artifacts/perf-run-1781737544-9539`
- JuiceFS latest full run: `docker/compose-xfstests/artifacts/juicefs-perf-run-1781746334-9398`
- Latest rejected BrewFS A/B: `docker/compose-xfstests/artifacts/perf-run-1781745250-11404`
- JuiceFS clean planning target: `docker/compose-xfstests/artifacts/juicefs-perf-run-1781732616-8549`

These artifacts include `perf-profile.env`, `runner-console.log`, and `runner-warning-summary.tsv`, which record the effective fio/filesystem tuning and flag noisy runs. The latest JuiceFS run completed with the aligned profile, but its writeback/cache path produced 4008 `WARNING` lines, 3991 timeout matches, 8 slow requests, and 5 slow operations, so the clean JuiceFS artifact remains the stable planning target. The table below reports the current kept BrewFS profile against the latest JuiceFS run and marks noisy writeback-sensitive results accordingly.

| fio tool | BrewFS MiB/s | JuiceFS MiB/s | BrewFS / JuiceFS |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `fio-bigread` | R 628.2 / W 0.0 | R 2398.1 / W 0.0 | 26.2% |
| `fio-bigwrite` | R 0.0 / W 1149.3 | R 0.0 / W 3271.6 | 35.1% |
| `fio-seqread` | R 1754.0 / W 0.0 | R 2508.7 / W 0.0 | 69.9% |
| `fio-seqwrite` | R 0.0 / W 69.2 | R 0.0 / W 255.9 | 27.0% |
| `fio-randread` | R 774.0 / W 0.0 | R 3310.8 / W 0.0 | 23.4% |
| `fio-randwrite` | R 0.0 / W 73.3 | R 0.0 / W 297.3 | 24.7% |
| `fio-randrw` | R 253.4 / W 113.8 | R 184.2 / W 83.4 | R 137.6% / W 136.5% |

| metadata op | BrewFS ops/s | JuiceFS ops/s | BrewFS / JuiceFS |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| create | 629.9 | 1365.5 | 46.1% |
| open | 9271.0 | 23568.2 | 39.3% |
| stat | 1022440.1 | 1018695.1 | 100.4% |
| readdir | 64070.5 | 67605.3 | 94.8% |
| rename | 1903.7 | 2720.8 | 70.0% |

Current interpretation: BrewFS is near parity for `stat` and `readdir`, competitive on noisy `randrw`, but still trails JuiceFS heavily on random/cold reads, pure writes, `create`, `open`, and `rename`. The next tuning rounds focus on file-to-file metadata open/create/rename overhead and writeback partial-tail aggregation while preserving the full scenario regression budget.

Latest rejected A/B: `docker/compose-xfstests/artifacts/perf-run-1781745250-11404` seeded the open-file metadata cache from `open_with_cached_attr` to mimic JuiceFS create-open behavior. It did not improve the target metadata path: `create` fell from 629.9 to 596.2 ops/s and `open` fell from 9271.0 to 9160.8 ops/s, while `randread` fell to 713.4 MiB/s and `randrw` fell to R 213.4 / W 95.6 MiB/s. The code change was reverted. Earlier rejected A/B `docker/compose-xfstests/artifacts/perf-run-1781741772-12024` removed the post-rename eager preload in `MetaClient::rename`; it improved `rename` only by 0.6% and regressed read/mixed workloads. Earlier rejected A/B `docker/compose-xfstests/artifacts/perf-run-1781739942-2326` disabled BrewFS cache checksum verification; it improved `bigread` but regressed `randrw` and `create`, so the main snapshot keeps full checksum verification enabled.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Rust 1.85+ (the crate uses Rust 2024 edition)
- Linux for FUSE mounting
- `fuse3` / `fusermount3` for unprivileged mounts

Run the SDK demo without FUSE:

```bash
cargo run -p brewfs --example sdk_demo -- /tmp/brewfs-sdk-data
```

Build the CLI:

```bash
cargo build -p brewfs --release
```

BrewFS defaults to the `io_uring` FUSE runtime. Build the Tokio FUSE runtime with:

```bash
cargo build -p brewfs --release --no-default-features --features fuse-tokio-runtime
```

Mount with local object storage and SQLite metadata:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/brewfs-mnt /tmp/brewfs-data

cargo run -p brewfs -- mount /tmp/brewfs-mnt \
  --data-backend local-fs \
  --data-dir /tmp/brewfs-data \
  --meta-backend sqlx \
  --meta-url sqlite:///tmp/brewfs-meta.db
```

Unmount with `Ctrl+C` in the mount process, or use `fusermount3 -u /tmp/brewfs-mnt` if needed.

## Configuration

BrewFS can be configured with CLI flags, a YAML file, or both. CLI flags override YAML values.

Minimal YAML:

```yaml
mount_point: /tmp/brewfs

data:
  backend: local-fs
  localfs:
    data_dir: ./data

meta:
  backend: sqlx
  sqlx:
    url: "sqlite::memory:"

layout:
  chunk_size: 67108864
  block_size: 4194304
```

S3 plus Redis example:

```yaml
mount_point: /mnt/brewfs

data:
  backend: s3
  s3:
    bucket: brewfs-data
    endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:9000
    region: us-east-1
    force_path_style: true
    disable_payload_checksum: true
    part_size: 16777216
    max_concurrency: 16

meta:
  backend: redis
  redis:
    url: "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"

cache:
  root: /var/cache/brewfs
  writeback_mode: upload_before_commit
```

TiKV metadata example:

```yaml
mount_point: /mnt/brewfs

meta:
  backend: tikv
  tikv:
    pd_endpoints:
      - 127.0.0.1:2379
    namespace: tenant-a
```

See [doc/configuration.md](doc/configuration.md) and the files under [examples/](examples/) for the full configuration surface.

## CLI

```bash
brewfs mount [OPTIONS] [MOUNT_POINT]
brewfs info [MOUNT_POINT]
brewfs gc [MOUNT_POINT] [--dry-run]
```

Useful mount options:

- `--config <FILE>`: YAML configuration file.
- `--data-backend <local-fs|s3>`: object data backend.
- `--meta-backend <sqlx|redis|etcd|tikv>`: metadata backend.
- `--chunk-size <BYTES>` and `--block-size <BYTES>`: data layout tuning.
- `--fuse-workers <N>`: `0` or `1` uses low-overhead asyncfuse session dispatch; values above `1` enable the worker pool.
- `--fuse-max-background <N>`: maximum queued and running FUSE requests.
- `--privileged`: use `/dev/fuse` directly instead of `fusermount3`.

## Testing

Fast local checks:

```bash
cargo check -p brewfs
cargo test -p brewfs
```

Focused checks used often during backend work:

```bash
cargo test -p brewfs meta::stores::tikv --lib
cargo test -p brewfs mount_config --bin brewfs
```

Docker-based filesystem tests:

```bash
cd docker
bash compose-xfstests/run_redis_xfstests.sh --cases "generic/001"
bash compose-xfstests/run_redis_xfstests.sh --s3 --cases "generic/001"
```

## Feature Flags

```bash
cargo build -p brewfs --release --features jemalloc
cargo build -p brewfs --release --features profiling
cargo build -p brewfs --release --features rkyv-serialization
```
