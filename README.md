BrewFS is a Rust filesystem for container, AI, and object-storage-heavy workloads. It exposes a POSIX-like FUSE interface, stores file data as chunked objects, and keeps namespace and slice metadata in a pluggable transactional metadata backend.

The core design goal is to decouple compute from storage: applications read and write normal paths, while BrewFS handles chunk layout, object IO, caching, metadata transactions, compaction, and garbage collection.

BrewFS is not a JuiceFS fork, but JuiceFS is the main production-grade reference point used for performance comparison and gap analysis. Current tuning work compares metadata caching, read/write cache behavior, writeback semantics, object-store amplification, compaction, and test coverage against JuiceFS so regressions and improvements can be measured against a mature baseline.

## Architecture

Main layers:

- `fuse` and `vfs`: inode-based FUSE integration and POSIX-facing behavior.
- `meta`: metadata client, transaction-capable backends, sessions, control plane, compaction hooks, and GC metadata.
- `chunk`: chunk/block layout, read/write path, cache, compaction, delayed deletion, and block-store GC.
- `cadapter`: object backend abstraction with LocalFS and S3-compatible implementations.
- `fs` and SDK examples: path-based API and local examples that can run without FUSE.

Default data layout:

- Chunk size: 64 MiB
- Block size: 4 MiB
- Object granularity: blocks addressed under slice IDs

## Current Capabilities

Data backends:

- `local-fs`: stores object data in a local directory for development and tests.
- `s3`: supports AWS S3 and S3-compatible services such as RustFS, MinIO, and Ceph RGW.

Metadata backends:

- `sqlx`: SQLite for local/dev and PostgreSQL for server deployments.
- `redis`: low-latency metadata operations with Lua/CAS based chunk updates.
- `etcd`: distributed KV metadata with transaction and watch-oriented semantics.
- `tikv`: transactional TiKV metadata backend with namespace, file data, hardlinks, symlinks, rename exchange, compaction hooks, and delayed/uncommitted slice GC support.

Filesystem and runtime features:

- FUSE mount via `brewfs mount`
- Path/inode operations for create, mkdir, readdir, stat, read, write, truncate, unlink, rmdir, rename, hardlink, and symlink
- Chunked sparse IO with zero-fill for holes
- Read/write cache with memory and SSD budgets
- Optional S3 writeback mode (`commit_before_upload`) with orphan cleanup support
- Slice compaction and two-phase block deletion
- Runtime control plane for `brewfs info` and `brewfs gc`

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Rust 1.85+ (the crate uses Rust 2024 edition)
- Linux for FUSE mounting
- `fuse3` / `fusermount3` for unprivileged mounts

Run the SDK demo without FUSE:

```bash
cargo run -p brewfs --example sdk_demo -- /tmp/brewfs-sdk-data
```

Build the CLI:

```bash
cargo build -p brewfs --release
```

BrewFS defaults to the `io_uring` FUSE runtime. Build the Tokio FUSE runtime with:

```bash
cargo build -p brewfs --release --no-default-features --features fuse-tokio-runtime
```

Mount with local object storage and SQLite metadata:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/brewfs-mnt /tmp/brewfs-data

cargo run -p brewfs -- mount /tmp/brewfs-mnt \
  --data-backend local-fs \
  --data-dir /tmp/brewfs-data \
  --meta-backend sqlx \
  --meta-url sqlite:///tmp/brewfs-meta.db
```

Unmount with `Ctrl+C` in the mount process, or use `fusermount3 -u /tmp/brewfs-mnt` if needed.

## Configuration

BrewFS can be configured with CLI flags, a YAML file, or both. CLI flags override YAML values.

Minimal YAML:

```yaml
mount_point: /tmp/brewfs

data:
  backend: local-fs
  localfs:
    data_dir: ./data

meta:
  backend: sqlx
  sqlx:
    url: "sqlite::memory:"

layout:
  chunk_size: 67108864
  block_size: 4194304
```

S3 plus Redis example:

```yaml
mount_point: /mnt/brewfs

data:
  backend: s3
  s3:
    bucket: brewfs-data
    endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:9000
    region: us-east-1
    force_path_style: true
    disable_payload_checksum: true
    part_size: 16777216
    max_concurrency: 16

meta:
  backend: redis
  redis:
    url: "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0"

cache:
  root: /var/cache/brewfs
  writeback_mode: upload_before_commit
```

TiKV metadata example:

```yaml
mount_point: /mnt/brewfs

meta:
  backend: tikv
  tikv:
    pd_endpoints:
      - 127.0.0.1:2379
    namespace: tenant-a
```

See [doc/operations/configuration.md](doc/operations/configuration.md) and the files under [examples/](examples/) for the full configuration surface.

## CLI

```bash
brewfs mount [OPTIONS] [MOUNT_POINT]
brewfs info [MOUNT_POINT]
brewfs gc [MOUNT_POINT] [--dry-run]
```

Useful mount options:

- `--config <FILE>`: YAML configuration file.
- `--data-backend <local-fs|s3>`: object data backend.
- `--meta-backend <sqlx|redis|etcd|tikv>`: metadata backend.
- `--chunk-size <BYTES>` and `--block-size <BYTES>`: data layout tuning.
- `--fuse-workers <N>`: `0` or `1` uses low-overhead asyncfuse session dispatch; values above `1` enable the worker pool.
- `--fuse-max-background <N>`: maximum queued and running FUSE requests.
- `--privileged`: use `/dev/fuse` directly instead of `fusermount3`.

## Testing

Fast local checks:

```bash
cargo check -p brewfs
cargo test -p brewfs
```

Focused checks used often during backend work:

```bash
cargo test -p brewfs meta::stores::tikv --lib
cargo test -p brewfs mount_config --bin brewfs
```

Docker-based filesystem tests:

```bash
cd docker
bash compose-xfstests/run_redis_xfstests.sh --cases "generic/001"
bash compose-xfstests/run_redis_xfstests.sh --s3 --cases "generic/001"
```

## JuiceFS Comparison

BrewFS tracks JuiceFS as a practical benchmark for distributed filesystem semantics and object-storage performance. The comparison is organized around three document sets:

- [JuiceFS internals notes](doc/juicefs/README.md): architecture, read/write paths, cache system, transactions, and slice compaction.
- [BrewFS/JuiceFS gap analysis](doc/gap/README.md): module-by-module gaps and iteration roadmap.
- [Performance roadmap](doc/performance/perf-optimization-roadmap.md): current tuning targets and validation expectations.

Use these notes to understand where BrewFS intentionally differs from JuiceFS, where it is still catching up, and which benchmark scenarios are used to guard against regressions.

### Latest Local Perf Snapshot

The following snapshot was collected on 2026-06-14 with the full Docker perf
runners under `docker/compose-xfstests/`:

```bash
bash docker/compose-xfstests/run_redis_perf.sh --s3 --writeback-throughput-profile
bash docker/compose-xfstests/run_juicefs_perf.sh --writeback-throughput-profile
```

Artifacts:

- BrewFS: `docker/compose-xfstests/artifacts/perf-run-1781466015-27228`
- JuiceFS: `docker/compose-xfstests/artifacts/juicefs-perf-run-1781467237-32007`

All default perf tools passed on both filesystems.

Wall seconds include close/flush tail. Fio bandwidth reports the active IO
window, so both columns are useful when diagnosing writeback behavior. This
snapshot used fio `direct=0`, as recorded in the generated fio JSON.

| Workload | BrewFS wall | JuiceFS wall | BrewFS fio BW | JuiceFS fio BW | BrewFS/JuiceFS BW |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `fio-bigwrite` | 2s | 0s | W 942.0 MiB/s | W 3.36 GiB/s | W 0.27x |
| `fio-bigread` | 3s | 1s | R 537.8 MiB/s | R 2.36 GiB/s | R 0.22x |
| `fio-seqread` | 61s | 61s | R 1.63 GiB/s | R 2.46 GiB/s | R 0.66x |
| `fio-seqwrite` | 153s | 126s | W 72.7 MiB/s | W 281.2 MiB/s | W 0.26x |
| `fio-randread` | 60s | 61s | R 758.3 MiB/s | R 3.21 GiB/s | R 0.23x |
| `fio-randwrite` | 150s | 143s | W 95.1 MiB/s | W 283.4 MiB/s | W 0.34x |
| `fio-randrw` | 177s | 61s | R 171.5 / W 76.9 MiB/s | R 179.6 / W 81.8 MiB/s | R 0.95x / W 0.94x |

Metadata comparison from `metaperf`:

| Operation | BrewFS | JuiceFS | BrewFS/JuiceFS |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `create` | 718 ops/s | 1320 ops/s | 0.54x |
| `open` | 9399 ops/s | 23506 ops/s | 0.40x |
| `stat` | 1021019 ops/s | 1024797 ops/s | 1.00x |
| `readdir` | 62898 ops/s | 91787 ops/s | 0.69x |
| `rename` | 1894 ops/s | 2676 ops/s | 0.71x |

Interpretation:

- This run used fio buffered IO (`direct=0`), so read bandwidth is a
  cache-aware regression signal rather than a pure cold-object-store maximum.
- BrewFS mixed `randrw` active IO bandwidth is close to JuiceFS, but BrewFS
  still has a much longer wall-time tail in that scenario.
- The main remaining data-path gap is writeback throughput: BrewFS is about
  0.26x of JuiceFS on sequential write and 0.34x on random write in this run.
- BrewFS internal stats point at small-object writeback amplification: this run
  uploaded mostly partial tails (`fio-seqwrite` averaged about 0.6 MiB per
  batch with 97% partial tails; `metaperf` uploaded 42k tiny batches for
  164.8 MiB of user writes).
- The JuiceFS run emitted slow PUT, disk-cache timeout, and `readSlice context
  canceled` warnings on the console, but completed all default scenarios as
  pass. Treat the JuiceFS write numbers as the current local-run result rather
  than an ideal upper bound for JuiceFS.
